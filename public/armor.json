Plus, I would never stoop so low as to disparage the work of an over-imaginative and obviously undersexed artist who managed to become a brazilianaire from barely-disguised erotica targeted at adolescent girls. However, I would like to take this opportunity to point out that your culture\u2019s obsession with fictional underaged heroes was absolutely misguided. Paul Atreides was fifteen years old. Harry Potter was just eleven in the beginning of the first book. The kids from Stranger Things were all tweens. Kid \u2018n Play were (portrayed to be) high schoolers when they threw that epic party. Fairy tales. Myths. Lies. Spoiler alert. Kids are all idiots, and when they\u2019re forced into a life or death situation, they overwhelmingly make stupid decisions and get themselves killed. Like, almost right away. They\u2019re like that rabbit you see sitting on the side of the road that decides to dart in front of your car at the worst possible moment. They\u2019re so efficient at getting themselves squished, you can\u2019t help but wonder if they're doing it on purpose. Go ahead. Complain. Tell me I\u2019m wrong. Trust me on this one. I\u2019ve done some pretty extensive and conclusive research on the matter. This apotropaic talisman looks like something a goth teenaged girl would shoplift from a Hot Topic. A girl who dreams about one day meeting a hundred-year-old predator and making him fall in love with her. Remember, it\u2019s not a crime if he\u2019s handsome or rich or looks like a teenager. Anyway, this bracelet imbues the following effects: \u2022 Protection against Vampirism. \u2022 Protection against Lycanthropy. \u2022 +25% Magical damage against all sapient undead.",
